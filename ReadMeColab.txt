"LoopEvalPortableCircularCut.C" is the macro that we are using to generate the relevant plots for electrons for all the detectors, namely- CEMC, EEMC, FEMC, FHCAL, HCALIN, HCALOUT. In the case of EEMC, we have used different fit functions for different slices, so we have used the macro "LoopEvalPortableCut.C" to write the text files - "gaus_1-4.txt" and "crystalball_5-10.txt" which contain the relevant fit parameters. These text files are read from a separate macro "EEMC_Manual.C" and then the relevant plots of sigma vs ge, mean vs ge and Reduced_chi2 vs ge are generated by the same.


For comparing the raw (te-ge)/ge vs ge plots, just using "LoopEvalPortableCircularCut.C" by giving the relevant detector as input would be enough.
